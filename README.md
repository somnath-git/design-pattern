In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design due to inflexibility in the creation procedures. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
